This repository contains source files for a hardware accelerator for integer exponentials. 

DECEMBER 28, 2022
    - New project started!
    - The hardware accelerator will be based upon the example datapath given in lecture, from CPEN 311 2022W1
    - So far, the draft exponent.sv file has been made, soon to be tested.
